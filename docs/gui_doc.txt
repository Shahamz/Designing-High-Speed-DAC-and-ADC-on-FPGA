GUI
****

Using the tkinter python liberary we created a gui to allow fast and easy loading and executing the program.

program_fpga():
---------------
Creates the tcl script that loads the bitstream and elf onto the board.

open_uart_connection():
-----------------------
Opens a uart connection between the processor and the host PC, for stdin, stdout, and stderr.

send_data():
------------
Sends data via the uart connection. 

read_uart():
-------------
Reads data coming from the uart connection.

plot_adc_data():
----------------
Plots the results of the ADC to a graph displayed in seperate window.

convert_result():
-----------------
Converts the ADC results to be plotted (from unsigned to signed).

resize_image():
----------------
Function to resize images while maintaining the aspect ratio. Used for the logos.

NOTES:
******
1. The physical set up should already be completed, meaning the board should correctly be connected to the ad-fmcdaq2-ebz, and the
   ad-fmcdaq2-ebz connected to the wave generator and the scope.
2. We used absoulute paths - to get it working on a different host, paths should be changed accordingly.
